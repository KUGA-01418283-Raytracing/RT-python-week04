# RT-python-week04
Ray tracing course week 04

This repository is for 'Raytracing in Entertainment Industry' (01418283).
This course is set to be taught for undergrad students at Dept of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University.
The codes were rewritten and modified from https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html.

**Prerequisites :**
1. C/C++ or python.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Linear algebra for undergrad students.


**Class assignment**

1. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render a square with various sizes and locations using different 't' and 'Interval'. 
2. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render 3 squares with various sizes and locations.
3. Replace 'get_center_ray()' with 'get_ray()'. See the difference between (2.) and (3.).
4. Generate random rays at the same pixel using 'get_ray()' and 'samples_per_pixel'. The result from 'get_color()' is then accumulated to 'pixel_color' and scaled in 'write_to_film()'. See the difference between (3.) and (4.).
